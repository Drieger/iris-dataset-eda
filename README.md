# The famous Iris flower data set

The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set used and made famous by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper _The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems_ as an example of linear discriminant analysis.

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

## Project Objective

The objective of the project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and train a model capable of classifying a flower into one of three species. This project follows the CRISP-DM framework.
